# Spice 🍽️ — Restaurant Web Application

Spice is a restaurant web application built as a learning and portfolio project.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a basic full-stack restaurant system using **C#/.NET** on the backend and **HTML/CSS** on the frontend.

This repository focuses on clean structure, clear separation of concerns, and practical implementation rather than over-engineering.
